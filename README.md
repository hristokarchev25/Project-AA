# Project-AA
ReactJS App:

At first it was going to be a MERN project, but I have changed my mind and I have decided to use Firebase for  backend!
The architecture is two main folders. One for FE (client) and the other for BE (server). But after i went with firebase the server folder is pretty much empty.
The client folder is the place where the react app is, also the components folder (with all of my created components) and utils folder (with the firebase config).

How to start it?
1. Open terminal
2. cd client
3. npm start
4. enjoy!
